Ultimate Accurate Hitbox Pack is a resource pack designed primarily for parkour players to see the most accurate hitbox for blocks that do not have a model that matches their hitbox.

Modified Blocks:

 - All fences
 - All fence gates (closed)
 - All walls
 - Chains
 - Pointed dripstone
 - Amethyst buds/clusters
 - Azalea/flowering azalea bushes
 - Ladders
 - Candles (lit and unlit)
 - Turtle eggs (at all break stages)
 - Sea pickles (alive and dead)
 - Lily pads
 - Big dripleaf
 - Chorus plant/fruit
 - Cobwebs
 - Bell (floor)
 - End rods
 - Lightning rods
 - Brewing stands
 - Lecterns
 - Campfires (all variants)
 - Soul sand
 - Mud
 - Dragon egg
 - Dried ghast

Known Issues:

 - Z-fighting on stacked fences/walls of different types (most likely won't fix)
 - Pointed dripstone texture isn't editable by other resource packs (might fix)
 - Dragon head/piglin head models aren't changed (can't fix)
 - Rotated mob heads don't align with hitbox (can't fix)
 - Z-fighting on chorus plant (won't fix because I hate the chorus fruit models)
 - Extra candles don't display particles (can't fix AFAIK--let me know if there is a way to fix that)
 - Bamboo fences look wack (might fix--kinda rushed these due to 1.20 being... already out (their models are totally different from the other fences and I haven't had the time to properly look at them))
 - Single turtle eggs don't match the hitbox at 75% of locations because of random block rotation (can't fix)

Please let me know of any issues or blocks I missed in the comments on PMC or Modrinth.
This pack has been tested and is confirmed to be working on release 1.19.4 and 1.20. It probably works fine on most older versions, and probably will continue to work for the foreseeable future--the 1.20 dot releases are almost definitely safe. On older versions it'll tell you that the RP was made in a newer version, but you can safely ignore that, just change the pack format if the warning annoys you enough.
